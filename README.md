I chose to learn more about he Vue.js because of  it’s growing popularity.
I tried to build Todo List app but did not finish it.

It solves problems like performance and flexibility as it’s  made out of components that can be re used to build a large-scale application’

One uses it to create front end web solutions with more flexibility, similarly to Angular or React.

Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects.

Vue.js is an MIT licensed open source project.

I like Vue because it seems to be pretty strait forward and focused regarding what it can do for you, but not opinionated about how you do it.
